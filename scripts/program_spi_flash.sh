# Astrial H15 SPI Flash Programming Script
# System Electronics - Hailo-15 Development Platform
# 
# This script programs the SPI flash memory with the necessary bootloader components
# for the Astrial H15 board. Run this script after building the Yocto image.
#
# Prerequisites:
# - Hailo-15 board tools installed in virtual environment (see README, "Setup
#   Tools and Environment"). They are NOT part of this archive: the wheel comes
#   from the Hailo Vision Processor Software Package.
# - Board connected via USB-Serial (typically /dev/ttyUSB0)
# - DIP switches set to programming mode (1=ON, 2=OFF)
# - Built Yocto image artifacts available
# - Root privileges (sudo) for serial port access
#
# Usage: ./program_spi_flash.sh [serial_device] [--with-b-slot]
# Example: ./program_spi_flash.sh /dev/ttyUSB0
#          ./program_spi_flash.sh /dev/ttyUSB0 --with-b-slot
#
# --with-b-slot also writes the second copy of the firmware, which the SCU
# bootloader falls back to when the first one does not start. Only useful with a
# layer built with SYSELE_SCU_FALLBACK_OFFSET set: without that, the descriptor
# list names one slot and the second copy is never read. Doubles the time.

set -e

echo "WARNING: This script requires root permissions for serial port access."

# Version of hailo15_board_tools that matches the Hailo stack this layer builds

# The two programs below are thin wrappers around the hailo15_board_tools Python

# ModuleNotFoundError from inside sudo.

ERROR: the Python package hailo15_board_tools is not available to $PYTHON_BIN

This package is not shipped in this archive. It is part of the Hailo Vision
Processor Software Package, which you download from the Hailo Developer Zone:

    https://hailo.ai/developer-zone/software-downloads/

Take hailo15_board_tools-${HAILO_BOARD_TOOLS_VERSION}-py3-none-any.whl out of it and install it:

    python3 -m venv hailo15_env
    source hailo15_env/bin/activate
    pip install hailo15_board_tools-${HAILO_BOARD_TOOLS_VERSION}-py3-none-any.whl
    pip install tftpy

Then run this script again with that virtual environment active. If it is
already active, check that "which python3" points inside it.
